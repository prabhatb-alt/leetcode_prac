# Two Sum: LeetCode Problem #1
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.   

# Approach 1: Brute Force

                    return [i, j]
                
# Time Complexity: O(n^2): Slow for larger inputs

# Approach 2: Using Hash Map
